Climate change, one of the most pressing issues in the 21st century, is increasingly threatening our society and development. China is undergoing its rapid industrialization and urbanization, and faces various challenges including the ‘tug-of-war’ between economy growth and climate change. Low-carbon economy is one of the keys for tackling such challenges and ultimately achieving sustainable development. Since the establishment of the Paris Climate Agreement in late 2016, China has made remarkable progress in curbing greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. This is partly evidenced by the launch of China’s National Trading Program and fulfilment of the Paris agreement commitment in advance. However, because of its political and economic structure, and that it is still at the very early stage of action, China faces various challenges constraining the implementation of climate change mitigation policies. Further, China’s climate policies, with low transparency and certainty, may give way to economic development under extradentary circumstances such as the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, China can make or break global climate change mitigation efforts in the future.

## Policy effectiveness constrained by policy itself

China’s current climate change mitigation policies are enforced primarily through administrative orders issued by the central government through Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE). However, policy quality has large impacts on policy implementation because of its dictatorship. Some outstanding issues include inappropriate and inopportune regulations that put setbacks to economic development, ambiguous terms that leave huge grey area, obligation-right imbalance that leads to resistant actions and speculations, and contradictions between different policies that make their implementation awkward. Many case studies of pilot provisional projects indicate such issues associated with policy quality form fundamental obstacles for policy implementation.

China has recently made progress in climate change legislations, but their enforcement is constrained largely by factors such as heavy reliance on centralised executive commands and low utilization of independent judicial means. For environmental lawbreakers, fine remains the most frequently used punishment followed by ordering for correction within a time limit and warning. However, the amount of fine stipulated by current laws do not even constitute an effective deterrent. This becomes a major obstacle to enforcing environmental laws, given the huge interest window between high compliance costs and low law-breaking costs. That said, even with complete and stringent legislation in the future, the Chinese political system and high corruption (with a corruption perception index ranking 80/180) still create significant challenges to policy implementation. Taking energy sectors as an example, the very challenging issue is ensuring compliance with legislations from those who play multiple pivotal roles in making, carrying out and manipulating the policies while monopolising almost the whole energy market.


## Resources limit implementation
Authority constitutes the key resource in ensuring policy implementation in China. MEE has been empowered with centralised authority in implementing climate change policies. However, MEE’s local branches and agencies are supervised, and hence subject to, local governments, threatening the independency of policy implementation and inspection. This is particularly problematic in places where local protectionism gives way to its economic development.

Apart from authority issues, county-level environmental policy implementation is largely subject to limited resources such as insufficient staff, funds and equipment. First, country-level staff number and quality do not meet practical needs. Second, their funds are subject to local economy and finance under the supervision of local government. Third, local policy implementation is further constrained by insufficient resources and equipment for supervising, inspecting and reporting environmental behaviours of both the governments and enterprises. For example, in some places, bicycle is the only accessible transportation for policy implementers, not even mention those expensive devices for professional analysis.

Serious environmental information asymmetries exist widely between policy implementers, governments, public and enterprises form the other key obstacle for policy implementation. This is manifested, for example, by distorted and contradicted data reported by different sources, and has serious impacts on the central government's environmental decision-making. Meanwhile, transparency issues in data reporting and administration make public engagement extremely challenging. 

##China’s carbon market is far way to grow up
In order to further reduce emissions, China launched its National Trading Program in 2017. The plan is to conduct spot trading in power generation sectors and then gradually expand to other sectors and trading types in 2020. However, its infant carbon market has a great number of problems and challenges. Below summarises a few according to recent research:

•	China's carbon market adopts a two-level management system from the central government to local governments. The local governments tend to excessively allocate their quota determined by the central government. Excess quotas and insufficient demand lead to variable carbon prices, weakening the role of carbon prices in guiding mitigation.
•	The ambiguous and incomplete top-down design of the carbon market results into poor coordination among functional departments and many other related units.
•	The incomplete Measurement, Reporting and Verification (MRV) system allows local governments to foster local MRV agencies that have complex interest links with local governments and enterprises, questioning the independency, authenticity and quality of their reported data. 
•	Because of limited and unenthusiastic market participants and lack of innovation in the fiscal system, the carbon market vitality is very low, which leads to poor market liquidity and low transaction volume and turnover. 
•	Uneven regional development and imbalanced industries pose great challenges. For example, underdeveloped regions need room for its economic development in the expense of carbon emission, otherwise it will exacerbate the already uneven regional development.

## Local governments’ play in the principle-agent game
The rapid economic growth of China is largely driven by local governments’ pursuit of GDP and the fiscal revenue it brings. Whether climate change policies are compatible with local governments’ incentives is the key to their effectiveness. As such, local governments play tactfully in the complex and complicated principle-agent games.

The central government's incentives for local government officials are primarily in the form of political promotion. Economic growth plays a decisive factor in the incentive mechanism, while performances related to climate change and environmental issues are yet to be properly accounted and measured. In order to pursue economic growth, local governments often adopt various approaches to resist, or make adjustments to, policy implementation within their jurisdictions. For example, “local policies” and “local regulations” formulated by local governments that are sometimes even contrary to national environmental laws, regulations and policies.

The local governments hold the true information about their own policy implementation. This leads to complex principal-agent games as a result of information asymmetry. For example, when signing mitigation target, provisional and its lower-level governments tend to conceal the true status of their jurisdictions and attempt to evade or reduce their obligations.

Local governments compete for economic benefits in order to obtain maximum political benefits, which leads to insufficient investment in environmental governance. Meanwhile, "race to bottom" in attracting investment and supervising resident enterprises makes inter- and intra-regional environmental policy corporation and coordination difficult.

## Insufficient and ineffective public engagement
Public engagement in implementing environmental policies is limited to certain areas and procedures in China. For example, the public has no voice in deciding which enterprise to be investigated/audited. Transparency issue forms the other big factor, while there are very limited channels for public to express their opinions.

The ineffectiveness of public engagement has very little to do with its current incentive schemes. Instead, it’s primarily because there are complex interest links between authorised environmental assessment agencies and those being audited. Further, different to western countries, current laws in China do not have clear terms judicially protecting public engagement in environmental policy enforcement. As a result, public participation is formalistically drifted away.

## Unpredictable factors may make or break global efforts
China’s achievements in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and curbing air pollution is significant and inspiring, with several studies suggesting that China can reach its emission peak earlier than its Paris climate pledge. However, there is not without worries, given that the centralised government may reconsider its dictatorial policies as circumstances evolve. For example, China’s GDP growth has been significantly disrupted amid the China-US trade war and the subsequent COVID-19 pandemic. This may possibly lead to relaxation of the mitigation policies and further delay of its National Trading Program in order to stimulate economic growth. Yet, such disruptive factors are unpredictable in the future, creating additional uncertainties and challenges to global efforts in tackling climate change.
