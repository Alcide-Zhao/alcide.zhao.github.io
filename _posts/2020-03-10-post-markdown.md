let me just put some quick notes on markdown syntax for reference. These ones are fairly cmmonly used. 

-  Headings `#(1-6)` <br/> 

-  Italics `*italics*`<br/> 

   *italics*

- Bold font `**italics**` <br/> 
    **bold font**
 
- Unordered list with `-` <br/> 
- Ordered list `1. 2. 3. ...` <br/> 
1. Ordered list 1
2. Ordered list 2

- Quote  `>` <br/> 

> This must be a qute from a grat scientist Alcide Zhao

- Horizontal line with three hyphens <br/>

- Inline code <br/> 
I just want to have some `inline code ` here, which should looks `fancy`

- Block code

<pre>
Aha, well, maybe a block of code is better
</pre>

- Math `$x^2$` <br/> 
how about some mathematical equations $x=y^2$
