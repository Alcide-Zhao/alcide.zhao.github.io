HTML standards for the Hyper Text Markup Language for Web pages. It describes the structure of a Web page, and consists of a series of elements. HTML elements are represented by tags; browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to render the content of the page. 


## An example

```
<!DOCTYPE html>             <!-- defines this document to be HTML5 -->
<html>                      <!-- the root element of an HTML page -->
<head>                      <!-- meta information about the document -->
<title>Page Title</title>   <!-- specifies a title for the document -->
</head>
<body>                      <!-- ontains the visible page content -->

<h1>My First Heading</h1>   <!-- defines a large heading -->
<p>My first paragraph.</p>  <!-- defines a paragraph ->

</body>
</html> 
```

## HTML tags

All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: `<!DOCTYPE html>`.

The HTML document itself begins with `<html>` and ends with `</html>`.

The HTML `<head>` element is a container for metadata , which is not displayed. The `<head>` element is placed between the `<html>` tag and the `<body>` tag
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My First HTML</title>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
</head>
<body>
```

The visible part of the HTML document is between `<body>` and `</body>`. 

HTML headings are defined with the `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags.

HTML paragraphs are defined with the `<p>` tag.

HTML links are defined with the `<a>` tag: `<a href="link_url">This is a link</a> `. The link's destination is specified in the href attribute.

HTML images are defined with the`<img>` tag; ` <img src="picture.jpg" alt="Alcide" width="104" height="142"> `

HTML buttons are defined with the `<button>` tag.

HTML lists are defined with the `<ul>` (unordered/bullet list) or the `<ol>` (ordered/numbered list) tag, followed by `<li>` tags (list items):
```
<ul>
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ul>
<ol>
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ol> 
```
`<br>` is an empty element without a closing tag (it defines a line break)

The `<hr>` tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule. It is used to separate content (or define a change). 

The HTML `<pre>` element defines preformatted text.

The HTML`<q>` for Short Quotations, and `<blockquote>` for block quotations.

The HTML `<abbr>` element defines an abbreviation or an acronym: ` <p>The <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr> was founded in 1948.</p> `

The HTML `<cite>` element defines the title of a work.

## HTML Attributes

All HTML elements can have attributes, which are always specified in the start tag. Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value". Lowercase attribute names

The `style` attribute is used to specify the styling of an element, like color, font, size etc.
```
 <p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.</p> 
```
  - Background-color: `background-color`
  - Text Color: `color=RGBA(255,99,71,1)` 
  - Font: `font-family`
  - Text size: `font-size`
  - Text alignment: `text-alig:[left|center|right]`
  - Border line width: `border:2px `

The language of the document can be declared in the `<html>` tag with `lang="en-US"`

A title attribute can be added to the `<p>` element. The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a `tooltip` when you mouse over the paragraph
```
<p title="I'm a tooltip">
This is a paragraph.
</p> 
```

## HTML formatting element

<b> - Bold text
<strong> - Important text
<i> - Italic text
<em> - Emphasized text
<mark> - Marked text
<small> - Small text
<del> - Deleted text
<ins> - Inserted text

## Styling HTML with CSS

CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.
