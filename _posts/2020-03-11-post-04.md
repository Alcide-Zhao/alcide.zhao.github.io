All people are talking about Xarray, which seems to be really powerful. I have been using Python 2.7 for more than 4 years, and God knows how hesitating I am to change to Python 3. However, perhaps, I must keep my standard up-to-date, in order not to, you know, being dismissed by my boss. 

**As mentioned above, Xarray was developed with Python 3, so you cannot use it in Python 2. **

### Why Xarray
If you look at their [official web](xarray.pydata.org/en/latest/why-xarray.html), what they are trying to convince you simply is the importance of labelling the axis of N-dimenssional data with more meaningful names (Likely DataFrame in pandas). This makes sense because it is less easier to make mistakes manipulating N-dimenssional data using labels than using axis (axis=0,1,2,...). 
It is also true that such codes may be easier to pick up even after a long time without touching it. However, this does not convince me, given that you can take notes using Jupyter notebook. 

Whatsoever, let's start !

### Data structure
**Xarray is just a dic-like N-D generalisation of pandas.series! **

- *DataArray*: An N-D generalization of a pandas.Series.
- *Dataset*:  A dict-like container of DataArray objects.
