All people are talking about Xarray, which seems to be really powerful. I have been using Python 2.7 for more than 4 years, and God knows how hesitating I am switching to Python 3. However, perhaps, I sould keep my standard up-to-date, in order not to being sacked. 

**As mentioned above, Xarray was developed with Python 3, so you cannot use it in Python 2.**

### 0.0 Why Xarray
If you look at their [official web](xarray.pydata.org/en/latest/why-xarray.html), what they are trying to convince you simply is the importance of labelling the axis of N-dimenssional data with more meaningful names (Like pandas.DataFrame, but extends dimenssion (ndim>2)). This makes sense because it is less easier to make mistakes manipulating N-dimenssional data using labels than using axis (axis=0,1,2,...). 
It is also true that, by labelling axis, it is easier to pick up a script after a long time without touching it. However, this does not convince me, because it is always a good habit to put sufficiently enough comments and nots on any scripts (Jupyter notebook is highly recommended!) 

To learn something from scratch, you must first understand its self-defined [terminologies](xarray.pydata.org/en/latest/terminology.html). I know, physicists can never communicate with artists easily!

Whatsoever, let's start !

### 0.1 Data structure
**Xarray is just a dic-like N-D generalisation of pandas.series!**

- *DataArray*: An N-D generalization of a pandas.Series.
- *Dataset*: A dict-like collection of DataArray objects with aligned dimensions (like a necdf file).

### 1.1 Creating a DataArray

The `DataArray` constructor takes:
   - data: a multi-dimensional array of values
   - coords: a list or dictionary of coordinates.
   - dims: a list of dimension names.
   - attrs: a dictionary of attributes to add to the instance
   - name: a string that names the instance
 To dump these fields, one can do `DA.values, DA.coords, DA.dims, DA.atrs, DA.name`
 <pre>
	import Xarray as xr
	import numpas as np
	data = np.random.rand(4, 3)
	locs = ['IA', 'IL', 'IN']
	times = pd.date_range('2000-01-01', periods=4)
	foo = xr.DataArray(data, coords=[times, locs], dims=['time', 'space'])
 </pre>
