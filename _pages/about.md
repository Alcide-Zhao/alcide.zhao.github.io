excerpt: What is the use of having developed a science well enough to make predictions if, in the end, all we are willing to do is stand around and wait for them to come true? Not even mention that science is to be suspected but not to be believed

I am currently a Research Scientist at the UK [National Centre for Atmospheric Science](https://www.ncas.ac.uk/en/) & [Department of Meteorology](https://research.reading.ac.uk/meteorology/people/alcide-zhao/) at University of Reading. I am working on two projects side by side, with one around dust aerosols in present generation climate models while the other focusing on the Subpolar North Atlantic Ocean. You can find my official page [here](https://research.reading.ac.uk/meteorology/people/alcide-zhao/).

I hold a PhD in Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences, completed in less than 3 years at [The University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/). My PhD, titled “Impacts of aerosols on air quality, climate and extremes”, was supervised by Prof [David Stevenson](https://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/homes/dstevens) and Dr [Massimo Bollasina](https://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/people/person.html?indv=3627&ri=1). My PhD project has unravelled important mechanisms through which aerosol changes influence climate and extremes, and has been widely covered by media including [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/20/tackling-air-pollution-heatwaves-longer-more-likely-study) and [BBC News](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-48174218?SThisFB&fbclid=IwAR320ixWy7ToyJ2-c30I_gukpTo_2uw-Cps5XVNmsHLr-nCoTgER2PSz120). Previously, I recieved my MSc and BSc in Oceanography (2014-2016) and Satellite Ocean Remote Sensing (2010-2014), respectively, from the [Ocean University of China](http://eweb.ouc.edu.cn/).

I am a contributing author to the [IPCC AR6](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sixth-assessment-report-cycle/) on atmospheric methane and oxidising capability, serving as one of the lead authors of the [AerChemMIP](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TKGX-Y7dGYr1U4ezsWYA9V8XmzHsSsNhNQ39ZVjPI4E/edit) joint analysis. I have broad interests in short-lived climate forcers, their impacts on radiative forcing and climate, using a variety of tools, ranging from observations and reanalysis to numerical modelling.
